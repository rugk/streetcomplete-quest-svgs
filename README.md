**Archived:** This repo has been archived, because [it is not needed anymore](https://github.com/rugk/streetcomplete-quest-svgs/issues/15), because the upstream StreetComplete repo now contains all the icons as SVGs, too: https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/tree/master/res/quest%20icons. Thus, please contribute there.

# StreetComplete quest SVGs

This repo just includes the quest icons of the app [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/). They were split out of the [original big SVG file](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/blob/master/res/quest_icons.svg). Of course, all credit goes to [@westnordost](https://github.com/westnordost) and other contributors (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)) for designing them.

I just want to collect them in a usable format here. This was done in order to add these icons to the [OSM wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete/Quests), where all quest types are listed.
